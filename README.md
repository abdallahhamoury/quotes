Lab: 08 - OO Design and GSON [README Link](labs/READMELAB8.md)

Use the file recentquotes.json to show random popular book quotes. Your program should use GSON to parse the .json file. The app needs no functionality other than showing the quote and the author when it is run. The app should choose one quote each time it is run.

We do still have this quotes file,
though, and it might still be useful! Ensure that if your app has errors in connecting to the Internet, you instead display a random quote from your file. When we grab a random quote from the Internet, we could add it to our file of quotes, for use if the app goes offline in the future. Add that functionality: when a quote comes back from a request, itâ€™s also cached in the json file.
